                                          <p>The best part of homestay is you will be treated as guest and not as a client. So, you can freely share how you feel and they will feel delighted to fulfill your wishes. You can even get engaged with them in their routine activities and ask what you want to taste or learn. You’ll be given proper care if you are tired or sick. And oh, there’s a magical healing power in local herbs. Don’t forget to try such wonders of Himalayas!</p>

                                        <p>‘Large hospitals and clinics in Nepal are centralized to Kathmandu valley and big cities only. Though there are small health posts providing basic treatment and medicines with normal checkup, you can’t expect the availability of necessary medicines and proper checkup everywhere you visit. You might definitely go on trekking up the Himalayas through steep pathway with no trace of residential area till your eyes could see. In such areas, prospects of hospital remain far beyond. So, you are suggested to carry basic first aid kit and your medicine (if any) not found elsewhere everywhere you travel. And don’t forget to read the health risk outlined in your itinerary or as description provided by your travel guide. 
                                        <br><br>
                                        In case you catch severe illness or there are some serious medical conditions, you will be evacuated to Kathmandu or overseas (to your home country) immediately. <br><br> So, before you venture into the land of exotic landscapes with skyscraping mountains, deep gorges, charismatic people, diverse culture and unique traditions, prepare yourself well so that you won’t miss even a moment to delve deep into the gorgeous lush forest with rare flora and fauna. Here are some useful tips to care your health while traveling Nepal: </p>

So, they won’t make it a big issue whatever you do. But it is better if you respect their cultures and value the precious time-bound traditions. <br><br>
                                        Whether you are visiting religious places or casually talking to locals, it is a good idea to keep in mind a few etiquette pointers as mentioned below: <br>

                                          You can simply greet ‘Namaste’ joining both hands to anyone anytime. You can learn local languages or gestures of greeting as the culture and religion of people keeps on changing every km you travel. However, you can greet ‘Namaste’ to anyone here.

                                          <p>You can ask your host if you are allergic to some foods or you can’t take it due to medical conditions. But it is not a good idea to waste food after taking a portion of it. You can just take a little first to taste and ask them for more if you like it. <br><br>
                                          Make sure you don’t walk over anyone, food or paper as it is considered disrespectful. Paper is worshipped as a form of Goddess Saraswoti and even if the food wrapper is of paper, throw it in a dustbin and be careful not to cross it over. Touching someone with your feet and sharing things with left hand is considered inauspicious. So, always use right hand to eat and take or give things. <br><br>
                                          Don’t take a sip of someone else’s bottle touching with your lips or offer the food you have already bitten as it is considered rude. Sharing same plate is not okay unless you are close to each other. <br><br>
                                          Further, don’t use your own used spoon to serve food as the food once touched is not acceptable in Nepal unless you are in close circle or are relatives.

                                        <h4>Etiquettes for Cultural/Religious Site Visit</h4>
                                        <p>In some of the Hindu temples, non-Hindus are not allowed to enter. Leather utensils are not allowed within temple premises and women during their periods are restricted to worship God. Before worshipping, most Nepalese walk around the temple in clockwise direction. Encircling the temple in anti-clockwise direction is considered inauspicious. <br><br>
                                        Take off your shoes before entering the temple premises and be careful not to burn out the burning candle. Always offer flowers to God either with right or both hands. The best way of sharing things is using right hand and touching the elbow of right hand with left hand. <br><br>
                                        Remember that some temples and cultural sites restrict photography inside the premises. Have a look for the board suggesting restriction so as to avoid fines. <br><br>
                                        Though the western culture is influencing Nepal at a rapid pace, revealing outfits are not still considered good. So, dress appropriately while you are visiting especially the rural parts of the country.

                                        <p>It is somehow okay to whistle outside (though not appreciated) but don’t even think about whistling inside someone’s house. It is believed that whistling inside would invite bad luck and considered rude if you whistle at someone. <br><br>
                                        Likewise, be careful how you node to ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A sideways tilt of head conveys ‘yes’ or you agree to something, not ‘no’ as in western culture. You can simply raise your palm and wave as if you are fixing your bracelet to say ‘no’.

                                          <p>You must be well informed about the diverse cultures and religions of Nepal. Yet all Nepalese live in harmony, you would better be informed about the cultural groups residing in area you are travelling. Learn few words including local greeting styles apart from ‘Namaste’.

                                          <p>Nepal is one of the top destinations for adventurous tourism. If you are thinking about hiking or trekking on your own, make sure you make necessary arrangements of your stay and safety equipment beforehand. We advise you to go on a group or at least with a friend. You may also hire a guide as the trekking trails might be confusing and you can easily lose tracks on the thick forest. See the altitude of place you are going on so as not to be the victim of altitude sickness or frostbite. <br><br>
                                          You might want to challenge yourself rafting in the whitewater of Bhote Koshi or Trishuli, rock climbing, mountaineering, paragliding above the mesmerizing Phewa Lake and go on the bone-chilling mountain trails for biking. You may want to go on the second highest Bungee Jumping of the world above Bhote Koshi River or climb the mighty mountains. But whatever you do, we recommend you to get informed about the possible threats first and do on the guidance of your guide only.</p>

You can also use water purifiers if you like but we advise you not to drink water directly from the tap. Ice might also have been made from tap water and fruits might have been washed directly from there. So, please be conscious on water safety if you don’t want to spend your vacation dreaming about all the fascinating things you could have done if you were not in hospital bed. </p>

However, the chances of obstruction due to landslide, flood and other natural disasters can’t be taken lightly. Take your travel insurance policy with coverage of thefts and prolonged stay. It’s better to prevent such incidents so as not to ruin your beautiful vacation in the lap of Himalayas!</p>
